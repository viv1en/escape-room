Wiping the sleep from your eyes, you find yourself yet again in the prison cell the guards threw you in months ago. Three other men are in the room with you. One is reading, while the other one stares at a crossword puzzle. The third is sleeping and snoring loudly. You swore yourself to find a way out of this place and have been cooking up an escape plan. You know it won’t be easy and that you won’t make it out on your own, but who can you trust inside these walls? You have considered asking your inmates for help, but haven’t decided if thats a wise decision. It’s time to get going. What should you do next?",
